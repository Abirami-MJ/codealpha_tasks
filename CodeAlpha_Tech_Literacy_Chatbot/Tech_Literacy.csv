What is Hardware?,"The physical parts of a computer you can touch, like the keyboard, monitor, and internal circuits."
What is the Cloud?,"It refers to servers accessed over the internet, allowing you to store and access data without using your local hard drive."
What is a CPU?,"The Central Processing Unit acts as the ""brain"" of the computer, executing instructions and processing data."
What is RAM?,Random Access Memory is short-term storage that allows computers to access data quickly for active tasks.
What is a motherboard?,"The main circuit board that connects all computer components like the CPU, memory, and hard drives together."
What is the difference between HDD and SSD?,"HDDs use spinning disks to store data, while SSDs use flash memory, making them significantly faster and more durable."
What is a GPU?,"A Graphics Processing Unit is a specialized processor designed to handle images, videos, and complex 3D rendering."
What is BIOS?,The Basic Input/Output System is software that initializes your hardware and starts the operating system during boot-up.
What is an Operating System?,Software like Windows or macOS that manages computer hardware and allows you to run applications.
What is the difference between System and Application software?,"System software runs the hardware, while Application software helps users perform specific tasks like browsing or typing."
What is Open Source software?,"Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance (e.g., Linux or VLC)."
What is a Driver?,A small piece of software that tells your operating system how to communicate with hardware like printers or cameras.
What is Virtualization?,Technology that allows you to run multiple virtual computers or operating systems on a single physical machine.
What is an IP address?,"A unique string of numbers that identifies a device on a network or the internet, acting like a digital home address."
How does DNS work?,"The Domain Name System acts as the ""phonebook"" of the internet, converting names like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com into IP addresses."
What is a Router?,"A device that directs data traffic between different networks, such as connecting your home devices to the internet."
